# Intro to Machine Learning

Why is it important to understand machine learning? Many machine learning techniques can solve interesting problems, from identifying email spam to classifying images. It is important to understand how libraries like scikit-learn work under the hood, to know their strengths and weaknesses, and to determine if they should be used for a given problem. 

What you'll learn—and how you can apply it

By the end of this course, you’ll understand:

What machine learning is and the various algorithms under its umbrella
How regression and classification techniques work, from linear regression to neural networks 
The API patterns of scikit-learn
And you'll be able to:

Use scikit-learn to make predictions on different types of problems, from email spam to image recognition 
Pair the proper application of supervised machine learning algorithms to a given problem and context appropriately
Explain how different machine learning algorithms work, including decision trees and neural networks
